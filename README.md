# Project Aster
Vulkan 1.2
C++20
Windows

A prototype renderer for fun
A counterpart to [Blaze](https://github.com/kidrigger/blaze)

## Idea behind Aster

I want Aster to be a easy to use practice bench that can allow me to 'play around' with graphics pipelines as well as write the final code in it.
Possibly write a scene/task graph conveniently.
This is with a plan to add automatic config and pipeline generation later.
